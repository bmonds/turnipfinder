# Turnip Finder

Turnip Finder is an application for use with Animal Crossing: New Horizons. 
Maximizing profits for selling turnips requires visiting other islands. The
ACNH community has come up with multiple sources to share and find islands
for buying or selling turnips. Turnip Finder will pull a list of islands and 
send a notification when an island matching the desired criteria has been found.

## But... why?
For the most part, just a fun little project to tinker with that I also find useful.
Instead of wasting time checking sites for available islands, I can send a
Discord bot a command and wait for the notification with matching islands.

## Usage
First you need to create a bot in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers).
Then add the bot to your Discord server. Once that is set up you can start
Turnip Finder using the bot's authentication token.
```shell script
./turnipfinder botauthtokenhere
```

The rest of the commands are sent as private messages with to the bot.
For a list of commands send the message `!help`.
